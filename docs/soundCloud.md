  ## 1. Preparation


Before using the SoundCloud music service, you need to prepare a valid SoundCloud account.
 
For first-time users, please open SoundCloud in the "Streaming - Music" menu on your device and follow the prompts to log in.
 
Reminder: The music content on SoundCloud is user-generated, and its core listening mechanism relies on users uploading their own audio or following other creators to listen to their works.
